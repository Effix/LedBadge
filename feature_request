Hi @Effix, great job squeezing more life out of the B1248! 

I just bought one and have something I'd like to run by you, as you appear to have unlocked 
the greycale potential of the screen. I'm a pixel artist/animator, not a programmer and
I would LOVE to be able to upload a series of 2-bit greyscale graphics to this device, and 
have them loop continuously as an animation. Would this be possible, or is it a pipe dream? 
Are you interested in exploring this with me, and if so, how can I be of assistance?

Thanks in advance, and for the good work you've already done with extending the possibilities for this device.
